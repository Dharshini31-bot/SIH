What is capacitor?
Capacitor: A capacitor is an electronic component that stores and releases electrical energy in a circuit. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric. When a voltage is applied across the plates, an electric field is created, and the capacitor stores energy in this field. Capacitors are used in various applications such as filtering, energy storage, and signal processing. They can temporarily hold charge, which can be released when needed.
What is diode?
Diode: A diode is a semiconductor device that allows current to flow in one direction only It has two terminals, called the anode and the cathode, and it functions as a one-way valve for electrical current. When the voltage applied to the anode is higher than that at the cathode (forward bias), the diode conducts current. When the voltage is reversed (reverse bias), the diode blocks the current. Diodes are commonly used in rectification, signal demodulation, and protection circuits.
